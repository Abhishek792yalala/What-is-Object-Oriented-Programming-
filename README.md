                     Object Oriented Programming

                     ===========================

    - OOP tries to map code instructions with real world making the code short and easy to understand.

    - Solving a problem by creating objects is one of the most popular approaches in programming and it is called the

      object-oriented programming.

    - Object: It is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template is defined. Memory is allocated only

      after object instantiation.

    - Class is a blueprint for creating objects.

1. Abstraction: hiding internal details, showing only essential info.

2. Encapsulation: the act of putting various components together(in a capsule). Sensitive data can be hidden from the users.

3. Inheritance: the act of deriving new things from the existing things.

4. Polymorphism: one entity in many forms.
